Built a Cats and Dogs Classifer using PyTorch. 
I used transfer learning to build my model. Used google colab to utilise their GPU which I lack in my system.

After building the model, I tried to deploy it on AWS Lambda but I couldn't. I have written a medium post on this. You can find it here: https://medium.com/@puthran.sohan/pytorch-in-aws-lambda-fc73bb43521e
